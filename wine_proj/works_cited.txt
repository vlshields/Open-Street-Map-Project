 Thank you to the Udacity Nanodegree program and all the instructors involved. I would not have been able to make many of the visualations and the work would have gone much more slowly if it were not for the fantastic instruction.

 The scale_IRF function written in the first cell block was inspired by a post in the udacity forums. Someone was asking how to apply that function they wrote, and I thought the idea of incorporating the reisling sugar guidlines into the dataset was a really good one. I figured since the post was already publically available in the DAND forums, that it would be alright to borrow the idea. I want to be very transparent about this. I did have to modify the function, because the logic in the function posted on the forum was incorrect, but I would never have had the idea if I did not see that post. Here is a link to that post:
